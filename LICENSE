Patent Notice
--------------
The algorithms, methods, data formats, microarchitectures, and architectural
designs embodied in this software are the subject of one or more pending patent
applications, including but not limited to:

  - U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/987,398
    "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR BLOCK-SCALE-FREE HIGH-RADIX FLOATING-POINT
    PROCESSING WITH EXPLICIT MANTISSA AND NATIVE LEXICOGRAPHICAL
    COMPARABILITY" (filed February 20, 2026)

  - Subsequent continuation, divisional, supplemental, and international
    filings claiming priority thereto.

Grant of Rights
----------------
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization
obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the
"Software"), to use, copy, and modify the Software solely for the following
purposes:

  1. Academic research and evaluation;
  2. Peer review and reproducibility verification of published results;
  3. Non-commercial educational instruction; and
  4. Personal, non-commercial experimentation.

The above grant expressly includes the right to run the Software, inspect its
outputs, and publish academic findings derived from its use, provided that such
publications include appropriate citation of the associated paper:

  Morisaki, K. (2026). "The AetherFloat Family: Block-Scale-Free Quad-Radix
  Floating-Point Architectures for AI Accelerators."

Restrictions
-------------
The following activities are NOT permitted under this license without a
separate, written commercial license agreement from the copyright holder:

  1. Commercial deployment — Incorporating the Software, or any portion
     thereof, into any product, service, or system that is sold, licensed,
     leased, or otherwise commercially distributed;

  2. Hardware synthesis integration — Using the Verilog, RTL descriptions,
     or synthesis scripts contained herein to produce, tape out, or program
     any physical or virtual hardware (including but not limited to ASICs,
     FPGAs, and silicon IP cores) for any purpose other than academic
     evaluation;

  3. Proprietary architecture incorporation — Integrating the floating-point
     encoding, MAC datapath designs, Lexicographic One's Complement mapping,
     Quad-Radix scaling methodology, Explicit Mantissa datapath,
     Precision-Upcasting emulation method, Asymmetric QAT datapath, or
     vector-shared stochastic rounding topology into proprietary hardware or
     software architectures;

  4. Sublicensing or redistribution — Redistributing the Software, in whole
     or in part, under any other license terms, or sublicensing rights
     granted hereunder to third parties; and

  5. Training of machine learning models for commercial purposes — Using the
     Software or its outputs (including quantized weights, training
     checkpoints, or calibration tables) to produce models intended for
     commercial deployment.

Redistribution of unmodified or modified copies of the Software is permitted
only if:

  (a) This license file is included in its entirety;
  (b) The patent notice above is preserved;
  (c) Modified files state prominently that they were changed; and
  (d) The redistribution is exclusively for a permitted purpose listed under
      "Grant of Rights."
